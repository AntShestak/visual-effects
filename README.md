My 1st C&amp;G examination project in C++ using DirectX


This is my first project in C++. This is part of my City&Guilds examinations towards Level 7 Diploma.

 Game is not polished and has many bugs. As part of this examination I have submitted a technical overview document where I describe
 most obvious bugs and ways to fix them, as well as the structure of the program, and the process of development and optimisation.
